Hi there !

I'm considering you are looking for some app or project that can convert your files or documents, so you found it !

The project uses EEL & Aspose-words libraryes for UI and document converting.

If you don't installed this libraryes before, you can just unarchive the venv folder, it contains virtual environment for python and also libaryes, that i mentioned before.

If you want to see the result, you should copy file that you want to convert to the project catalog beside converter.py (it uses the relative paths), when you start the project choose file that you copied !

After a few moment apears a window that tells you that converting is done !

Some links and comands:
https://www.python.org/downloads/ - download python

venv\Scripts\activate - open cmd and put this comand, ones you unarchive venv.zip (you should unarchive it where it's stays, don't move it somewhere)
python converter.py - to start the project (put it after putting venv\Scripts\activate), once you done you tasks, put deactivate on cmd to deactivate venv
